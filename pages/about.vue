    <h1>About Knowledge Base</h1>
    <p>
      Knowledge Base : A personal knowledge management system built by and for <a href="https://github.com/sumirseth"><i><u>Sumir Seth</u></i></a>. That aims to consolidate information and knowledge in a single place, making it easily accessible and searchable.
    </p>
    <p>
      What started as a little idea for a project I was working on, quickly grew into a full-fledged knowledge management system. It's a simple and intuitive and by far the best way to manage my knowledge, especially if it comes from the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is one of the best things I've built, especially for myself. But you can host your own instance of it too. It's open source, so you can contribute to it and make it better.
